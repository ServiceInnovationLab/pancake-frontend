    This service is still in testing and development phase (Alpha) and is
    currently having some improvements made. Come back in a week or two. :-D
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is
      a video of the first iteration of the service so you can see what it is like.
      It has been designed around comprehensive research about the needs of people
      who are eligible for the rebate, many of whom donâ€™t even know it!

    <p>
      The Rates Rebates Alpha was tested in Tauranga in May/June 2018 for the final
      applicants to the 2017-18 rating year. The testing went well with users and
      Council staff, and is currently offline for a couple of weeks whilst we integrate
      some improvements from the first testing phase. We have had requests from some
      Councils to extend the testing for another few months to ensure the approach
      works across different Councils and communities, so we will be putting a 2018-19
      rating year version of the service up by the end of July for participating
      Councils to test in August and September.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are in a Council and are interested in participating in the extended
      Alpha in August/September, please contact <a href="mailto:Siobhan.mccarthy@dia.govt.nz">Siobhan.mccarthy@dia.govt.nz.</a>
